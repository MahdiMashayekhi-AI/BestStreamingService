# BestStreamingService
For analyzing which is the best streaming service, I will be using the ratings of shows on all the major platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney.ðŸ§ 

There is a lot of competition between all the major streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. As a Data Scientist, it could be a very amazing task for you to find which is the best streaming service among them. In this article, Iâ€™m going to introduce you to a data science project on the best streaming service analysis with Python.

I am using this dataset to find the best streaming service but as a beginner, you can also use this dataset for the tasks such as:

1-Analyzing the streaming platforms</br>
2-Analyzing the IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes ratings of all the shows</br>
3-Analyzing the target age group of most of the TV shows</br>
